# READY TO ROCK BARCELONA

## Motivation

This project was designed only for testing purposes.

It's a tool for browsing a directory of local rock bands. Their descriptions are extracted from an API that gets and transforms info from a json file, so you can think on this project as a fullstack application.

## Other information

It consists in a unique repo with two independent applications working together:

- frontend: REACT
- backend: nodejs + express

ES6 and testing are available in both sides.

Every part (client and server) has it's own README.md with instructions. Please feel free to browse it.
